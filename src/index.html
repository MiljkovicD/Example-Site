                <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers
                    compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference
                    Pacific Division. The Lakers play their home games at Staples Center, an arena shared with the NBA's
                    Los
                    Angeles Clippers, the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association, and the Los
                    Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League. The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the
                    history of the NBA, and have won 17 NBA championships, tied with the Boston Celtics for the most in
                    NBA
                    history.</p>

                <p>The franchise began with the 1947 purchase of a disbanded team, the Detroit Gems of the National
                    Basketball League (NBL). The new team began playing in Minneapolis, Minnesota, calling themselves
                    the
                    Minneapolis Lakers. Initially a member of the NBL, the Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before
                    joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they would win five of the next six
                    championships, led by star George Mikan. After struggling financially in the late 1950s following
                    Mikan's retirement, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960-61 season.</p>

                <p>Led by Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West, Los Angeles made the NBA Finals six times in the
                    1960s, but lost every series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the
                    Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain, and won their sixth NBA
                    title and first in Los Angeles in 1972, led by new head coach Bill Sharman. After the
                    retirement of West and Chamberlain, the team traded for superstar Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who won
                    multiple
                    MVP awards with the Lakers. While the team was unable to advance to the Finals in the late 1970s,
                    two
                    momentous changes came in 1979 that would inaugurate a new golden era for the franchise. First,
                    Jerry
                    Buss purchased the Lakers, and as the team's owner, pioneered a vision of basketball games as
                    entertainment spectacles as well as sporting events. Second, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson first
                    overall in the 1979 NBA draft.</p>

                <p>The combination of Johnson, a passing prodigy, and Abdul-Jabbar provided the Lakers with two
                    superstars
                    to anchor their roster. The additions of head coach Pat Riley in 1981, and James Worthy through the
                    1982
                    NBA draft, established the Lakers as an NBA powerhouse in the 1980s. The team was nicknamed the
                    Showtime Lakers due to its fast break, transition offense facilitated by Johnson. The team
                    won five championships in a nine-year span, including several marquee Finals matchups against its
                    archrival, the Celtics.</p>
                <img class="home_img home_img--default" src="assets/images/Shaq_Kobe.jfif">
                <p>
                    After Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, and Worthy retired, the team struggled in the 1990s until it drafted
                    Kobe
                    Bryant and signed Shaquille O'Neal in 1996. The superstar duo, along with Hall of Fame coach Phil
                    Jackson, led the Lakers to three consecutive championships between 2000 to 2002, securing the
                    franchise's second three-peat. After the team lost in the 2004 NBA Finals, the
                    Shaq-and-Kobe era ended when the Lakers traded away O'Neal. It was not until the Lakers
                    traded for Pau Gasol that Bryant and Jackson returned to the NBA Finals, winning two more titles in
                    2009
                    and 2010. The team failed to regain its former glory during the rest of the decade, and Bryant
                    retired
                    in 2016. In 2020, the Lakers led by LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and coach Frank
                    Vogel secured their 17th championship, tying the Celtics for the most titles in NBA history.

                    The Lakers hold the record for NBA's longest winning streak, 33 straight games, set during the
                    1971-72 season. Twenty-six Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while four have coached
                    the team. Four Lakers Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, O'Neal, and Bryant have won the NBA MVP Award
                    for a total of eight awards.</p>
