                Founded in 1947, the Lakers are one of the NBA's most famous and successful
                franchises. As of summer
                2012,
                the Lakers hold the all-time records for wins (3,125), winning percentage (.620), and NBA Finals
                appearances (32). They are tied in NBA championships with the Boston Celtics, winning 17 NBA titles and
                making far more finals appearances than their biggest rival (15 vs 4 in being runner up), effectively
                making
                them the most successful to date. Their team have included some of the game's greatest players,
                including
                George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Clyde Lovellette, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Wilt Chamberlain, Gail Goodrich,
                Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jamaal Wilkes, James Worthy, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, and
                LeBron
                James.

            <p class="text-image_text">
                By the 1984–85 season, the Lakers' so-called "Showtime" era was in full swing. Showtime was a
                fast-paced style of basketball, described as a mix of "no-look passes off the fastbreak, pin-point
                alley-oops from halfcourt, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through triple teams."
                The team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year, this time by an NBA-record 20 games
                ahead of second-place Portland. They also set team records for field-goal percentage (.545) and assists
                (2,575). For the ninth time, they faced the Celtics in the finals. The championship series got off to a
                disastrous start for the Lakers, losing Game 1 of the Finals by a lopsided score of 148–114, in what is
                now remembered as the "Memorial Day Massacre". But the Lakers were resilient and behind 38-year-old
                Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar, they were finally able to topple Boston in six games. Abdul-Jabbar proceeded to
                dismember the Celtics with his deadly skyhook move, and Los Angeles won Game 6 111–100 in Boston Garden,
                one of the greatest triumphs in franchise history. The Lakers gained their first ever Finals victory
                over the Celtics, and they were the only visiting team to ever do this in Boston Garden.

                Despite topping the league with a 67–15 record in the regular season, the Lakers found themselves
                struggling in the playoffs, needing all five games to knock off the Sacramento Kings and coming back
                from 15 points down in the fourth quarter of Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals against Portland.
                The Indiana Pacers, coached by the Lakers' old nemesis, Larry Bird, proved to be slightly less of a
                problem, however, and in six games, the Lakers claimed their first NBA championship since 1988.
                Shaquille O'Neal picked up both MVP and Finals MVP awards in 2000. Having also shared the 2000 All-Star
                Game MVP award, he was only the third player in NBA history to win all three awards in the same season.
                Kobe Bryant was named to the NBA All-Defensive Team, the youngest player to earn the honor. Bryant had
                blossomed under Coach Jackson, as had Lakers role players such as Derek Fisher, Rick Fox and Robert
                Horry.

            <p class="text-video_text">
                On July 3, 2009, the Lakers signed Houston Rockets forward Ron Artest to a five-year contract to replace
                Lakers forward Trevor Ariza who signed with the Rockets. The Lakers once again won the Western
                Conference and made it to their third straight finals. In the 2010 NBA Finals, the Lakers were rematched
                with the Boston Celtics. Faced against much of the same roster that they had played with in 2008, the
                series played out very tightly, with both teams trading wins for the first four games. After the Celtics
                won a decisive game 5, the series moved back to Los Angeles where the Lakers would win in a rout. Coming
                down to the fifth game 7 in the rivalry's history, Boston played well in the early goings of the match.
                However, the Lakers would rally in the fourth quarter to a raging Staples Center crowd. Led by Bryant
                and Gasol's rebounding, and with clutch shots from Ron Artest and Derek Fisher, the Lakers would win
                their franchise's sixteenth NBA championship. Bryant was awarded his second consecutive Finals Most
                Valuable Player Award.

                During the 2019–20 season, the Lakers made the playoffs for first time since 2013. Leading up to this
                however Kobe Bryant passed away on 26th January. The team qualified for the 2020 NBA playoffs with a
                52–19 record as the first seed in the Western Conference for the first time since 2010 and 17th time in
                franchise history. Again the team would be beset with tribulations with the entire season in doubt due
                to the coronavirus pandemic with several NBA players testing positive. The season was resumed months
                later in Orlando in Disney World under special circumstances, played in the same arena without fans and
                few spectators, where the teams would spend months without leave (Over 3 months for the finalists).
                In the first round they faced the Portland Trail Blazers, after losing Game 1, the Lakers then
                eliminated the Trail Blazers by winning four straight, it was the Lakers first series win in 8 years.
                The following round, Houston Rockets took a one-game lead, with the Lakers responding with four straight
                wins again, taking the series and advancing to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since
                2010. The Lakers then beat the Denver Nuggets 4–1 to move on to their first NBA Finals in exactly a
                decade. In the 2020 NBA Finals, the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in six games to win the franchise's
                17th NBA title, tying them with the Celtics for most championships in league history.
